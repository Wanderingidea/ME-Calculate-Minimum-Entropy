# Minimum-Entropy

The purpose of this program is to calculate the <i>minimum</i> entropy of a file (as opposed to the Shannon entropy calculation).

me.pas compiles without problems with Freepascal under Linux x86_64 and armv7l cpu architectures.

Sample output:

`me < test.bin`

minimum entropy: 0.99879457 bits per bit
